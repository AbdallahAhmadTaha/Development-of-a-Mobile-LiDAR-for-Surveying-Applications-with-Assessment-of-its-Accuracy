## 📖 Overview

This thesis presents the design and implementation of a mobile LiDAR system using VB.NET and off-the-shelf hardware. The software reads raw `.pcap` files from a Velodyne VLP-16 LiDAR sensor, processes positional data, and integrates RTK corrections from NMEA files.

🔧 The application features:
- Frame and GPS data extraction from `.pcap`
- 3D point computation from LiDAR scans
- RTK GNSS integration with UTM conversion
- SLAM trajectory import and comparison
- Smoothing, transformation, and trajectory export
- Preview and visualization of 3D
